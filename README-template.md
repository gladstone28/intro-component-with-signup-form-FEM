## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://codepen.io/gladstone2/pen/yLQONKd/5be5092948146ced2723ec987e5b14d0) - This helped me for codepen. I really liked this links to resources that I can use going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/intro-to-ui-ux/lessons/ui-and-ux-prototyping-with-figma/exercises/layers-panel) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the Figma Layers Pane. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
